# DynamoDB Local Utilities (for Mac OS X)

This is a simple pair of scripts for having DynamoDB load on your Mac OS X
machine every time you boot up. Simply follow these instructions:

1. Clone this repo somewhere (fork it first if you wish to make changes).
2. Download DynamoDB local as per [Amazon's instructions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Tools.DynamoDBLocal.html).
3. Check you have *Java 1.7* installed from [Java.com](http://java.com/en/download/mac_download.jsp).
4. Copy, or symlink, `run.sh` into the directory that you extracted `dynamodb_local` into. It's a pretty straightforward file and will run DynamoDB Local on port 3232 as given - customize to meet your needs.
5. Copy, or symlink, the plist file into `~/Library/LaunchAgents`. This is to tell the Mac OS X builtâ€“in tool `launchctl` how to run DynamoDB on start up. You will need to customize it with the absolute path of where you extracted DynamoDB - under both `ProgramArguments` and `WorkingDirectory`.
6. From inside `~/Library/LaunchAgents` run `launchctl load com.amazon.aws.DynamoDBLocal.plist`. This should load and start DynamoDB Local - you can check with Activity Monitor, `htop`, etc., or by connecting your app code to it.
7. Congratulations! You're now ready to run/test DynamoDB applications locally!!!


## N.B. Problem with Version 2014-01-08

I've encountered a problem with the version of DynamoDB Local from this date
running on OS X 10.8.5. It appears that even though the `java.library.path` is
set correctly in the command, DynamoDB Local fails to find its sqlite4java
library, dying with this error:

    cannot load library: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no sqlite4java-osx-x86_64 in java.library.path

The fix for this is to copy the library into your overall java lib directory,
which if you're using Java 7 as the above instructions tell you to, you'd just
need to:

    sudo cp DynamoDBLocal_lib/libsqlite4java-osx.jnilib /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/lib

Hopefully this will be fixed in a later version though.
